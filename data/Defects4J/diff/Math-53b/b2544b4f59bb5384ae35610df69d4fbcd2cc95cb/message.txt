Made a nubmer of change to the ExpandableDoubleArray.

* This class now supports
the ability to move the starting index of the internal element array.  This
allows one to move the beginning of the element array, and form a sort of
"window", this will come into play when we want to provide moving
averages, or "rolling".

* Added an addElementRolling(double v) - this will increment the startIndex
and add the element to the end of the internal element array

* brought the Clover test cases up to 100% for this class

Added a class ContractableDoubleArray:

* This is an extension of ExpandableDoubleArray - it addes a configuration
parameter contractionCriteria.  Essential if the contractionCriteria is
2.0f we commit to never having the internal storage array provide more
than 2.0 times the storage capacity needed.  Once the internal
storage array exceed this measurement, the internal storage array is
pruned to the size of the internal element array.

Also, my IDE scolded me for some ununsed imports in ListUnivariateImpl, they
have been removed.
