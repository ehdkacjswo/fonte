o cleaning up the maven descriptors for the projects so that a site
  with decent names is generated (link to come)

o made all the projects use a LICENSE.txt file. one this doesn't wig
  out windows users and the checkstyle report likes to have one to
  make sure that all sources files have a license present so if they
  don't it can be reported.

o using the reactor tag in its first forms to provide a mechanism
  to build the entire commons (still problems with detecting
  JDK 1.4) and to generate a site where the navigation is gleaned
  from the project themselves and don't have to kept in sync
  manually.

o added a little front-end site deployer.
