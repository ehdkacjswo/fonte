Applying Sven Ludwig's patch from LANG-626. This modifies the SerializationUtils.clone method to use the threadContextLoader if it is unable to find a class using the object's current classloader. This should (hopefully) help with Weblogic and Tomcat situations where Lang is outside the web-inf for some reason (likely user error with Tomcat, by design for Weblogic)
