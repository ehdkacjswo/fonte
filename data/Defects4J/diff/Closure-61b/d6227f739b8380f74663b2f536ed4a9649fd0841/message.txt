Add half-assed support for late-resolved typedefs of union types.
The fundamental issue is that NamedType is a proxy wrapper around
ObjectTypes, but has always been used for non-object types (like
typedef'd unions.
I eventually want to move towards the using UnresolvedTypes for type
resolution. Under that system, the proxy wrapper gets thrown away.
UnresolveTypes would also solve this issue. But that system breaks
a whole bunch of assumptions about hash codes and referential
transparency, so we're not ready for it yet.
