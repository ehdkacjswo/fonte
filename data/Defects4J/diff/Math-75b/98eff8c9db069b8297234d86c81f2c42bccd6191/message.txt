Its more logical not to have increment return a value, this allows a 
distict separation between the calculation of moments and the 
calculation of the actually return value of getVlaue in Storageless 
approaches. With this benifit it is no longer neccessary to calculate 
all the statistics moment based statistics on addValue, only the 
underlying moment itself.
