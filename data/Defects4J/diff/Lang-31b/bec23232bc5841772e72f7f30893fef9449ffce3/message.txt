Applying Boris' patch in LANG-481 to improve thread safety in the Range classes. The previous code's reuse of the hashCode variable for local operations means it is utterly non-thread-safe. Now uses a local variable so that the worst case should be the hashCode being calculated multiple times, but not ending up with different values.
