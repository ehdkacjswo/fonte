Add the experimental source map format. This basically compresses the Maps source map
from 50MB to a little less than 9MB (less when using using the SYMBOLS node filter):

It does this in a couple of ways:
1) It removes pulls filenames into a common section, and uses ids to map to them.
2) It uses an alternate encoding for the line maps to take advantage of some of the properties of them to reduce the redundancy there.
