        optimize disk I/O a bit by skipping goog.provides/requires
        after actual JS. This is consistent with what the other
        dependency tools do.
        Also, force the caller to use a Reader for file contents.

        some more regexp-fu to catch a case i missed
        (where you have "/**\n", so there's no matching char after
         the second star)
