I've thought about this and I like the idea of getting some of this code available in the cvs for experimentation, I'm going ahead and adding it for others to look at and consider.

This directory will not get compiled into the regular build process or future distributions. We can work on an ant script to provide easy build of this if others think it neccessary.
