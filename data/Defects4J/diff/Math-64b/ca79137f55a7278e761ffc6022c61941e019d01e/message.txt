Collection of patches to initial Mantissa sources:
- Fixed a problem when switching functions triggered derivatives
  discontinuities
- Removed methods and classes that were deprecated in Mantissa
  and do not need to be preserved in commons-math as backward compatibility
  is not a problem for this newly integrated code
- Changed Vector3D and Rotation to immutable classes for ease of use
- Improved some javadoc in class Rotation
JIRA: MATH-161
