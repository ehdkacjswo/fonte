Finally, implemented the feature that shows verbose types in some corner cases (e.g. method takes long but the user just uses eq(100) instead eq(100L)). Previously, Mockito didn't print verbose args and the user could see "arguments are different, wanted: foo(100) but got: foo(100)". Now the user on the occasion will see "arguments are different, wanted: foo((Integer) 100) but got: foo((Long) 100)"
