Changed the vargars behavior of argument captor. I prefer if the captor handles the varargs seamlessly, e.g. without any extra methods. The change needs some refactoring and documentation. The previous implementation was nice and had nice coverage - we might want to put that back if our users request extra methods for retrieving varg values from the captor.
