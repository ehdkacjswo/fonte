issue 352 : With answer ReturnsEmptyValues, Mockito-mocked methods returning primitive types other than "int" throw ClassCastException: java.lang.Integer.
Thanks to Jesse Wilson for spotting that one and providing a patch.
I changed a few things however  especially:
 - used Primitives utility class instead
 - applied underscored names for test cases, as decided internally
