A bucket of cold water. The MockitoInvocationHandler interface does not make much sense yet. Internally we cast it anyway to an internal type. This means that this API is not yet ready to be completely public. No problem, though, I made the MockitoInvocationHandler a marker interface. The contract of the MockMaker at the moment is that it should not create own instances of MockitoInvocationHandler. Instead, it should keep hold on the instance that is provided by Mockito. Documented this contract in the MockMaker interface.

Down the road MockHandlerInterface will merge into MockitoInvocationHandler and the invocation API will be completely open. For now what we have should do.
