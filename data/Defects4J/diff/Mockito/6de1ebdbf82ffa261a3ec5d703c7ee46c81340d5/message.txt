This test didn't pass when run with all the other test. This is due to objenesis cache not resetted, it uses an instantiation strategy that creates a mock that belongs to another classloader, hence a classcast was thrown in the ClassImposterizer. And all of this because IMethods was already used. This commit makes use of some class only loaded in the classloader being used here (so objenesis only sees that class in this test)
