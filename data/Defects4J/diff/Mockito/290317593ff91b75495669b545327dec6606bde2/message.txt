yet another big check-in due to some off-line work
-added the logic that resets ongoing stubbing on certain framework operations (mock, verify, doReturn). This is necessary to have better feedback from the framework when something is going wrong.
-started adding validation on matchers. Matchers also use thread-local state so they should also take part in state validation
