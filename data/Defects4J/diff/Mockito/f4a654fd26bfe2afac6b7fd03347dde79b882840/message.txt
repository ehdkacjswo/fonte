Copied the Pluralizer class to a private package. Left the deprecated variant just in case some uses it (however I think it's unlikely).

rename : src/org/mockito/exceptions/Pluralizer.java => src/org/mockito/internal/reporting/Pluralizer.java
rename : test/org/mockito/exceptions/PluralizerTest.java => test/org/mockito/internal/reporting/PluralizerTest.java
