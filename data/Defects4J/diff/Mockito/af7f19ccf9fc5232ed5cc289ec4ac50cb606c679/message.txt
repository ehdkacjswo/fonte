In order to make Mockito compatible with previous versions I had to change the return type of InvocationOnMock.getMethod()
Renamed one test class to be consistent with renamed class

--HG--
rename : test/org/mockito/internal/invocation/SerializableMockitoMethodTest.java => test/org/mockito/internal/invocation/SerializableMethodTest.java
extra : convert_revision : svn%3Aaa2aecf3-ea3e-0410-9d70-716747e7c967/trunk%401668
