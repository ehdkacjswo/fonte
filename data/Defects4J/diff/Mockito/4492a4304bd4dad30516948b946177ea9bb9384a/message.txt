In order to fix issue 94 and make people who write extensions for Mockito happy I changed the way CGLIBHacker works. I made him traverse the object graph in case the MethodProxy class has been proxied. I added powermock-reflect as test-dependency to the project. It should be the runtime dependency as I'm trying to avoid too many runtime dependencies.
