MATH-397. Modified "AbstractUnivariateRealOptimizer" so that its usage is
more similar to what is done in package "optimization.general".
Deprecated many methods as a consequence of the new layout.
New utility methods in "ConvergingAlgorithmImpl".
Temporary workaround in "BrentOptimizer" (requirement from base class) to
avoid committing two issues at the same time...
