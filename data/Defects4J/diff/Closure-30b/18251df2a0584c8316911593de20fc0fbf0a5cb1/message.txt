Always declare a symbol for 'this', even if there are no
references to it.
This almost gets the new JS indexer up to feature parity with
the old one.
This makes some fundamental changes in how "this" is represented
in the SymbolTable codegraph, and I think this should make the
code a lot more flexible, so that we can expose "this" in
many different ways without changes to jscompiler.
