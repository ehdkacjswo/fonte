*** Reason for rollback ***

*** Original change description ***

Namespaces created by jscompiler should be @const.
This helps type-checking a lot, because it doesn't have
to worry about someone re-assigning the namespace.
If you want a namespace to be non-const, you can
just declare it explicitly.
