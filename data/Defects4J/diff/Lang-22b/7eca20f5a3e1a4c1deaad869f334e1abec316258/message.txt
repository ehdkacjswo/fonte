Refactoring toBoolean(String) and toBooleanObject(String) so that the latter has the same optimizations. I did this by pointing the former to the latter. I had to rewrite the optimizations a bit so they didn't auto-return as the latter considers null and false to be different. I also had to add specific support for false, no and off for the same reason. LANG-633
