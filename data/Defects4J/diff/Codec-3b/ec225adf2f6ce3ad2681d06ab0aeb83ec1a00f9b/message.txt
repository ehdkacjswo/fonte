The StringEncoderComparator used to call o1.toString(), and
o2.toString() on the parameters supplied to the compare
method.  There is no need to require that only Strings
are passed to the StringEncoderComparator - (actually
there is no reason why we couldn't have a generic Encoder
comparator.  This patch is the first step towards a more
generic object, and it allows us to test the exception condition
in this compare() method.
