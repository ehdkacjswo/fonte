Return of WordWrapUtils, fresh with bugs fixed in StringTaglib. Part of the
reason for dropping it originally was that I knew my methods [wordWrap rather than wrapText or wrapLine] had nasty die-a-death bugs and hadn't had time to fix them. These got fixed as a part of String Taglib so I'm now personally happy with the code. As happy as you can ever be anyway without more tests to hurt it.
