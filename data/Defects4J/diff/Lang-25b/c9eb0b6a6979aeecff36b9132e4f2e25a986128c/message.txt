o Changed type of "cause" instance field from Nestable to Throwable.
Since implementation of Throwable is already required, this doesn't
change the interface, but does simplify the internals.

o Simplified code in getThrowableCount() method by removing extraneous
null check and extra reference.

o Implemented suggestion by Joachim.Sauer@tp-soft.com to use
ExceptionUtils where Nestable.getCause() was previously called.
