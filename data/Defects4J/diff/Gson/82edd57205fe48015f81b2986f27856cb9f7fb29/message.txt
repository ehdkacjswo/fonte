Add a JSR-305 @ThreadSafe annotation to the Gson class

- Add an optional dependency to com.google.code.findbugs:jsr305.
  The optional scope is used in order to avoid introducing a new
  transitive dependency to the jsr305 library. This is fine because the 
  @ThreadSafe annotation has only a documentary purpose and it is not
  retained at runtime.
- Annotate the Gson class as @ThreadSafe

Fixes Issue #613
