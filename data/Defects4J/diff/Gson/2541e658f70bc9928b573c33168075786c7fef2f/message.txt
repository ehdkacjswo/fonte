Fixed com.google.gson.functional.VersioningTest.testIgnoreLaterVersionClassDeserialization by changing Gson behavior incompatibly (but more consistent).
GSON 1.x applies different rules for versioning for classes vs fields. So, if you deserialize a
   JSON into a field that is supposed to be skipped, the field is set to null (or default value). 
   However, if you deserialize it to a top-level class, a default instance is returned.
GSON 2.x returns null for the top-level class.
