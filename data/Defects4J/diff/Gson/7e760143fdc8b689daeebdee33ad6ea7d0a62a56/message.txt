Smash together MiniGson and Gson. This changes Gson to be the MiniGson rather than delegating to the MiniGson. It means that the MiniGson objects passed into streaming type adapters are now fully-capable 'Gson' objects. 

The most notable impact of this change is that it adds several new public APIs:
 - The TypeAdapter abstract class
 - The TypeAdapter.Factory interface
 - Four new methods on GsonBuilder to register streaming TypeAdapters (via Factory, via Class, via TypeToken, and as a type hierarchy)
 - Three new methods on Gson to lookup streaming TypeAdapters (by type, by class, and to get the next type adapter) 

Still outstanding:
 - Write beautiful prose to document the new APIs above
 - Change GsonBuilder's precedence so that both old and new-style type adapters are registered in one lot
