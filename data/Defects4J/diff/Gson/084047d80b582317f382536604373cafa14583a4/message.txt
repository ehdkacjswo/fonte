Reintroduce string pooling in JsonReader.

This makes Hotspot slower. From my before/after measurements using ParseBenchmark, times in microseconds:
  TWEETS: 350 -> 370 (+6%)
  READER_SHORT: 77 -> 76 (-1%)
  READER_LONG: 870 -> 940 (+8%)
  
But it makes Dalvik faster by a greater margin. These before/after measurements use times in milliseconds:
  TWEETS: 25 -> 20 (-20%)
  READER_SHORT: 5.6 -> 4.7 (-16%)
  READER_LONG: 52 -> 47 (-10%)
 
 It's a net win because we're saving a greater fraction of time, and because we're helping the platform that needs the most help. We're paying microseconds on Hotspot to gain milliseconds on Dalvik.
