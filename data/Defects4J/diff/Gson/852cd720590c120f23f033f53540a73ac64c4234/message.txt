Don't allocate a whole bunch of objects each time we deserialize a map key. This saves 20% on bug 375's benchmark.

The fix here is quite distasteful; I'm adding an ugly backdoor API for MapTypeAdapterFactory to fiddle with the internal bits of JsonReader. I'd like to revisit this sooner or later, but for now I'll take the speedup.
