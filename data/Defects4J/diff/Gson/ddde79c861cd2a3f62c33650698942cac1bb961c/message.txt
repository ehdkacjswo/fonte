Added a deepCopy() method in GsonBuilder. This allows a web-service to create a pre-configured GsonBuilder and then for each request, create a Gson instance by adding type adapters to a copy.
In TypeAdapter.Factory.create() method, using the term gson to refer to the Gson instance instead of a little ambiguous context.
