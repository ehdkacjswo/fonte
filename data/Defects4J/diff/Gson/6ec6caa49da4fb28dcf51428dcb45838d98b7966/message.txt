New extension: handle circular references.

Serialize graphs of objects by assigning each instance a generated ID and writing the complete graph out as a list. The output for a cycle of Rock/Scissors/Paper looks like this:

{
  '0x1':{'name':'ROCK','beats':'0x2'},
  '0x2':{'name':'SCISSORS','beats':'0x3'},
  '0x3':{'name':'PAPER','beats':'0x1'}
}

This is work towards issue 137. The hard part is going to be deserializing that back into a graph.
