Docs fixes: markdown, links, formatting.

* Removed extra spacing after bullets in list
* Removed extra blank lines; fixed indentation
* Fixed all links (including examples) to code.google.com to use github.com
  instead; deep links to code.google.com redirect to top-level GitHub project
  page, thus rendering them useless
* Removed extra strings in Markdown link targets
* Fixed capitalization and grammar
* Added more code formatting
