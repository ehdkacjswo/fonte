Created new projects:
1. wsdef: contains classes that are used to define a Gson based JSON web service
2. wsclient: contains classes that are used to write a Gson based web-service client

wsf is now only a server-side framework. Moved classes relevant for wsdef and wsclient from it to the individual projects.
