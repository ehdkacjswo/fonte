For the Collection and Map types, using ObjectConstructor to create instance instead of hard-coding a specific type. 
This helps is handling cases where the user is using their own subclass of Collection or Map.

Updated ParameterizedTypeHandlerMap to return the handler corresponding to Map and Collection for subclasses if user has not specified a specific handler.

Fixed the logic in JsonTreeNavigator to not output a comma if the first field of an object was null.
