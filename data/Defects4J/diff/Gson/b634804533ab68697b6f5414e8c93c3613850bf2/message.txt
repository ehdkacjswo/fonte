Ensured that a base class custom serializer is run when the type is specified explicitly during serialization. For all other situations, ensured that the actual type of the object is taken into consideration while serializing. First a custom handler corresponding to the actual type is looked up, then a custom handler for the specified type. 
Created some serialization specific tests regarding custom serializers. Revised some tests to use toJsonTree for better asserts instead of string matching.
