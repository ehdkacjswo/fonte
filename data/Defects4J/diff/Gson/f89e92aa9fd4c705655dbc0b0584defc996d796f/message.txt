Tighten up some of the fields naming policy code. The main thrust of this change is replacing classes like UpperCaseNamingPolicy with the corresponding method calls. Classes like CompositeFieldNamingPolicy are replaced by sequences of method calls. This also replaces unit tests with functional tests.

One nice benefit of this is a 3%/5.7KiB reduction in the size of gson.jar to 184KiB.
