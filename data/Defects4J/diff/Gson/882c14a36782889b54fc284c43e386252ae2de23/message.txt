Added support in Gson for serializing/deserializing from primitive char.
Created a new class for character/char tests, PrimitiveCharacterTest. This is the start of breaking down PrimitiveTest into smaller chunks.
When MiniGson can not find a type adapter for a type, revised the message to say can't handle instead of can't serialize.
