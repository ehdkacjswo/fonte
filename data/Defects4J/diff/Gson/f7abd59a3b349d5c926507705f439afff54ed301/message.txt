JsonWriter#jsonValue writes raw JSON values.

Add a jsonValue(String value) method that takes a raw JSON string that
can be used to write the string directly to the underlying writer
without modification.

The intended use case for this is when building JSON that contains a
pre-serialized JSON string as a value in an object or array.
