Add an experimental rewrite of JsonReader.

The motivating difference is that JsonReaderV2 tries to read each character at most once. This means that when it reads literals, it also attempts to decode them to a keyword (true/false/null) or a number.

This change also _doesn't_ read strings until demanded to do so. This should permit streaming access to strings down the road.

This code is not yet complete, nor is has it been properly optimized. And the implementation is also quite a mess! It is a work in progress.
