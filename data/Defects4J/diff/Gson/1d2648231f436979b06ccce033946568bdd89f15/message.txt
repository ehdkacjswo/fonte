Revised the hashCode of Id to be based just on the value. Also, revised the equals method to return true when the only difference in the type is that one class is Foo and other is Foo<?, ?>. Added a compact toString() in the Id class that prints the type as MyType<Foo,Bar> instead of fully qualified names for each of the types.
Added tests regarding object equality for the Id class.
