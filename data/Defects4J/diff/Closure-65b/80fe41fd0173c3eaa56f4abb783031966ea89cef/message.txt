        In AmbiguateProperties, invert the related type relationship, by
        considering subclasses and implementors (down) instead of superclasses
        and implemented interfaces (up). This has two advantages:

        - The 'independent of' relationship is simplified, because we only
          need to consider whether the related types intersect.

        - We can account for 'multiple inheritance', which is a practical
          issue because of interfaces.

        Note that the 'up' relationship allows us to easily find common
        ancestors while the 'down' relationship allows us to easily find
        common descendants -- and this is what we care about for ambiguation.
