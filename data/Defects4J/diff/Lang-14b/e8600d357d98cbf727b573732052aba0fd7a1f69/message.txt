Applying my modified version of Chris Hyzer's patch from LANG-180 - adding a replaceEach(String, String[], String[]) and replaceRepeatedly(String, String[], String[]) pair of methods. The internal code to the private replaceEach method has not been fully reviewed yet - I wanted to get more eyes focused on the algorithm
