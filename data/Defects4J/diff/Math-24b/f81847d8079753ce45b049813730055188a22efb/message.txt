Fixed a wrong assumption on BSP tree attributes.

The assumption was that the attribute was always a boolean when boundary
was empty. This assumption was false when emptiness resulted from a
collapsed boundary. Boolean attributes occur only at leaf nodes, so it
is the cut sub-hyperplane that needed to be checked.
