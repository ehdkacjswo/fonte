Added a way to get the reverse mapping info out of source maps. Added an interface so you can know when source maps are reversable, and two new methods on reversable source maps.

One methods allows you to introspect on the sources in the source maps, and the other, given a source file and line + column information, returns the reverse (source --> target) source mapping, if there is one.
