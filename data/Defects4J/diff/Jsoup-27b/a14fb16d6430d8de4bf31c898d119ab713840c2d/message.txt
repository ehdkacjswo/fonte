Fixed issue with selector parser where some boolean AND + OR combined queries (e.g. "meta[http-equiv], meta[content]") were being parsed incorrectly as OR only queries (e.g. former as "meta, [http-equiv], meta[content]")

Fixed issue where a content-tye specified in a meta tag may not be reliably detected, due to the above issue.
