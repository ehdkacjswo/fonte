Use a StringBuilder to accumulate attribute values.

When initially implemented I expected attribute values to normally be read in one sweep,
removing the need to accumulate values. However profiling shows that attributes are
often accumulated, and so the string concatination implementation was very slow.

Using a StringBuilder here gives reduces parse times > 50%.
