Proposal: change how we represent property sets on objects.
I went down this rabbit-hole to experiment with a few different things:
- Separating property bookkeeping from type relation bookkeeping.
- Use the same property-store for "new Foo()" and "Foo.prototype".
I don't think that maintaining separate property maps for these two
types actually buys us anything, and it's inconsistent with how they're
used in practice.
- Use the same property-store for "Foo.<Bar>" and "Foo.<Baz>"
I actually like how this ended up--it's a lot easier to see how properties
are inherited. But I'm curious what others think.
