Annotate test classes that are branched off joda-time core for joda-time-gwt. The annotated test classes are used as a basis to generate the gwt test classes.
Also change the default java.util.Locale and java.util.TimeZone to verify which test cases are actually depending on these defaults (these tests are marked in the code as well). In the generated gwt test classes Locale and TimeZone are not supported so these statements will be removed.
