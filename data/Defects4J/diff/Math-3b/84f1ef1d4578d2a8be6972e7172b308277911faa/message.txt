- refactored top level of Exception hierarchy,
- added getPatern(), getArguments() and getMessage(Locale)
  (names chosen for consistency with java.text.MessageFormat)
- deprecated some raw constructors as the top level exception are too
  coarse grained and intended only as base classes for easier to use classes
- added several constructors for use by more fine grained derived classes
