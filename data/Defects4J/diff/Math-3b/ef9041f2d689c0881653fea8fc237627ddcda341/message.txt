Added a few linearCombination utility methods in MathUtils to compute accurately
linear combinations a1.b1 + a2.b2 + ... + an.bn taking great care to compensate
for cancellation effects. This both improves and simplify several methods in
euclidean geometry classes, including linear constructors, dot product and cross
product.
