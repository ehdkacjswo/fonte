separated iteration counter from function evaluation counters,
some optimizers are based on gradient/jacobian only and cannot
reliably be protected by monitoring the objective function calls.

We now have two or three counters for each algorithm:
 - iteration counter, which is checked against a max allowance
   to prevent infinite loops if no convergence is reached
 - objective function evaluations, for user information only
 - objective function gradient/jacobian if the function is
   differentiable, for user information only
