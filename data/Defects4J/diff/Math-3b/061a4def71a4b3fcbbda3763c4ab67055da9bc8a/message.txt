Added adapters for simple bounds constraints optimization.

The adapters are useful only for optimizers that do not support simple
bounds constraints by themselves (i.e. Nelder-Mead and Torczon's
multidirectional). Two adapters are available, one performs a mapping
between the whole real range and the bounded range (bounds being set
component wise), and one uses a penalty function.
