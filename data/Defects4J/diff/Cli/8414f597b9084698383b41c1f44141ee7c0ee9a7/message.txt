Remove mvdb-svg-plugin patch. I merged the patch with the current svg plugin codebase, so this is not needed anymore. Version 1.2 will contain all the changes.
Added comment in project.properties.
For those who get worried of having to add another plugin to build the site : CLI doesn't need it, since it will use the images in SVN if the plugin is not there.
