As #38845 states, three tests in this class fail. This is because they make assumptions about the default datetime formatting instances. I've made them non-default, which should allow tests to pass. Two do pass for me, but the third oddly enough doesn't - somehow it turns 23-Dec-2003 into 2003-12-22. Very odd.
