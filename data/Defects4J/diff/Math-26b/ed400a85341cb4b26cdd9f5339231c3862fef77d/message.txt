MATH-653
Renamed "AbstracRealVector" to "RealVector" (getting rid of the "interface").
Changed "SparseRealVector" from "interface" to "abstract" class.
Modified subclasses ("extends" instead of "implements") and unit test name
("RealVectorTest" instead of "AbstractRealVectorTest") accordingly.
Slightly modified "UnmodifiableRealVectorAbstractTest" to exclude methods
that are now inherited from "Object".
Changed unmodifiable vector view from a static inner class to an anonymous
class.
