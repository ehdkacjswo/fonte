Refactoring following the promotion of embedded class o.a.c.m.transform.FastFourierTransformer.RootsOfUnity to standalone class o.a.c.m.complex.RootsOfUnity
- computeOmega(int n) now computes exp(2 * pi * i * k / n), k = 0, ..., n - 1, instead of exp(-2 * pi * i * k / n) (which was more natural for FFT).
- isForward() does not mean anything outside the FFT context. It has been renamed isCounterClockwise(), which refers to the way the roots of unity are ordered.
See MATH-677.
