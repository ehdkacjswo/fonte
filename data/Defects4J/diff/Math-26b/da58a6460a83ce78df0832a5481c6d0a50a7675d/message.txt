A complete generic implementation of Binary Space Partitioning Trees (BSP trees)
has been added. A few specializations of this implementation are also provided
for 1D, 2D and 3D Euclidean geometry. This allows support for arbitrary
intervals sets (1D), polygons sets (2D) and polyhedrons sets (3D) with all
sets operations (union, intersection, symmetric difference, difference, complement),
with predicates (point inside/outside/on boundary, emptiness, other region contained),
with geometrical computation (barycenter, size, boundary size) and with conversions
from and to boundary representation.
