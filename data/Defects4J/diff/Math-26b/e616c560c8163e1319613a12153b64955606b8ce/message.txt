In class o.a.c.math3.linear.SymmLQ
  - Changed parameter order for the constructor of nested class State (for consistency with the constructor of SymmLQ).
  - Moved some static helper methods from SymmLQ to nested class State
  - Changed visibility of some static fields from private to protected in order to avoid the use of synthetic getters.
See MATH-761.
