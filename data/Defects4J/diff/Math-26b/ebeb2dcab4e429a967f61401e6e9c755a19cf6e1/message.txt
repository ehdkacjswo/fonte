Added javadoc to FixedDA and altered exceptions in DoubleArray

* One should be able to use a DoubleArray in a similar way to a
regular double[], to this effect methods for accessing element
values will no longer throw NoSuchElementExceptions when an
index is outside of the element set.  These method all throw
ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException if a bad index is supplied.

* Filled out javadoc in FixedDoubleArray.
