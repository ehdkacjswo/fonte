Licensing issues have prompted the removal of all source reliant on
Gamma.java.  Gamma.java explicitly stated that it was "based on" an
implementation from Numerical Recipes in C.  Please see
http://www.nr.com/infotop.html - these implementations (and derivatives
of these works) are covered under restrictive licensing terms.  This
code will be removed from the repository until these issues can be
addressed.
