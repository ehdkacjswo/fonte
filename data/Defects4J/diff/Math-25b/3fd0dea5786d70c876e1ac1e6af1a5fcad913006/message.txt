MATH-795
  - Factored out testSerial().
  - In RealVectorTest, the vector returned by create(double[]) should really be
of type RealVectorTest.TestVectorImpl, as the minimal implementation is to be
tested. This causes some tests not to pass, they are skipped for the time
being (overriden from RealVectorAbstractTest, without @Test annotation). When
the tests in RealVectorAbstractTest are split, only the smaller tests which do
not make sense in the present context will be skipped.
  - In RealVectorTest, the constructor of RealVectorTest.TestVectorImpl now
makes a defensive copy of the specified double[] array (see Javadoc of
    + RealVectorAbstractTest.create(double[]),
    + RealVectorAbstractTest.createAlien(double[]).
