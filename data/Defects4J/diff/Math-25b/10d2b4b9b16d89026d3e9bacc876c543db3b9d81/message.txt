Rewrite StatUtils to use static instances of UnivariateStatistics. Benefits? 

1.) In the future, when we establish "Factories" for these objects, we'll be able to plug implementations in, even under our static Utilities classes for these functions. 

2.) The  user can always rely on the same result, whether using the StaticUtil, Univariate Container or direct UnivariateStatistic.
