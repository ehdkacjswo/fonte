added a lazy evaluation for step interpolators
moved the possible exceptions from setInterpolatedTime (which now does almost nothing) to getInterpolatedState and getInterpolatedDerivatives (which now do the evaluations)
renamed an internal function to make sure people overriding it don't forget to set the derivatives
