MATH-650
Suggesting to use "resource" files for storing large tables.
"FastMathResource" is a utility for creating and loading those resources.
"FastMathLoadCheck" modified to allow the benchmarking of the various ways
to create the tables needed in "FastMath".
"FastMathResourcesSave" shows how to create the resource files (not a "user"
functionality, as this should be done only once): The resource files have
been created and are located under "src/main/resources/data".
