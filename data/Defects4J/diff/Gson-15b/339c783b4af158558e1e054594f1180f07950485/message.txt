Updated the ProtoTypeAdapter to a version that works smoothly and supports field name/value customization.
- Lets you customize the proto field name serialization per field
    - Lets you use different cases for serialization (e.g. you could use UpperCamelCase for your proto field names and willing to serialize them using LowerHyphen)
    - Lets you choose to serialize enum values with their value (0, 1, 2, ...) instead of their name.
