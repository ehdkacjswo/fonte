Implemented enhancement request from issue 42 by supporting a new GsonBuilder setting generateNonExecutableJson() that prefixes the generated JSON with some special text that makes the output non-executable javascript. Gson now recognizes this special text in the input while parsing the JSON in fromJson and filters it out, if present.
