Fixed the bug where copyOf() for a ParameterizedTypeHandlerMap was failing when hierarchical type adapters for a sub class and its base class were present.

Fixed previously broken tests to verify the behavior that a hierarchical type adapter for a sub-class can be registered after registering a hierarchical type adapter for the base-class. The vice-versa is not allowed as it would result in hiding the sub-class hierarchical type adapter.
