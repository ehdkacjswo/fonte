Decode JSON literal types eagerly and with our own decoder.  Previously we relied on Double.parseDouble() to decode tokens. Since that method is expensive, we deferred calling it unless absolutely necessary. Now we decode the literal type immediately. For efficiency we decode the token right out of the char buffer. This makes things more complicated but it saves many calls to charAt().  It also opens up the possibility to deferring string creation.
