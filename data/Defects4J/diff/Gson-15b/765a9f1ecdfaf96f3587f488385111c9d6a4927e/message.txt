Brand new classes for streaming JSON efficiently.

Notable features:
 - Efficiency. The parser is faster than the current javacc parser. It's also faster than popular libraries for JSON streaming.
 - Toggle lenient/strict
 - Toggle pretty/compact
 - Friendly error messages on bad JSON
 - GSON-quality Javadoc
 - Non-execute prefix handling

This doesn't wire JsonReader up into Gson just yet. That's coming soon...
