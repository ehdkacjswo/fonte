Replace localhost lookup with static IP to fix test.

Calling InetAddress.getLocalHost() will cause a lookup to occur that may
fail with a java.net.UnknownHostException if the system the test is
running on is not configured correctly.

This is often fixed by echoing "127.0.0.1 $HOSTNAME" to /etc/hosts, but
in this case it seems easier to pick a static IP string to avoid the
lookup entirely and prevent false negatives in the test.
