Swap out GSON's type mechanics with the Type resolution code from Guice.

The most significant impact of this change is that fields whose types are type parameters should now GSONify just fine. For example, consider the class below.

abstract class Foo<A, B> {
   A a;
   B b;
   List<A> list;
   Map<A, List<B>> map;
}
class RealFoo extends Foo<String, Integer> {...}

This is a reasonable checkpoint but some work still needs to be done for this. In particular, the level of visibility of methods in TypeToken and Type should be reconsidered; we're exposing more than we need to!
