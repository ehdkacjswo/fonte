Major restructuring of Primitve type serialization and deserializtion.  From the end-user's point of view there should be no difference other than the user can now override the default serialization/deserialization their own custom type adapter (not sure if there is a real use-case out there for this).

This restructuring greatly cleans up the code and reduces some complexity; however, there is more that can be done to clean this up (i.e. get rid of "InstanceCreators" for primitive Type Adapters).
