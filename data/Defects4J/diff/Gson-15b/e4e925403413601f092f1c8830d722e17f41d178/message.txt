Added an asynchronous client for invoking Web-services. This client uses a queue to hold web-service requests and returns the control back to the caller. A separate thread executes these web-service requests and invokes a caller-suplied callback with the results.
Made WebServiceClient reusable across different type of Web-service calls.
Added configurable logging support in RequestSender, ResponseReceiver and WebServiceClients. Added some logging.
Throwing WebServiceSystemException instead of RuntimException.
