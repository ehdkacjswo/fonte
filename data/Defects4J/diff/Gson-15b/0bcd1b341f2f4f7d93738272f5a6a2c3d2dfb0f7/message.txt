Revised Gson to refuse to deserialize floating point numbers into integer types.
This is probably a break from the past: previous versions of Gson allowed truncating a floating point into a long or int. However, it wasn't consistent in this behavior. It disallowed converting a BigDecimal value into BigInteger, int or long. Refusing to deserialize such values is aligned with fail-fast approach of uncovering bugs.
