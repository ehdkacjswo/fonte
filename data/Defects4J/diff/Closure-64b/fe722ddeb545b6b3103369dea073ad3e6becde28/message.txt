Change the default pretty printer so that then clauses of if
statements and bodies of for statements get printed in blocks
and on separate lines even if the the body is a single statement:
if (a) {
b
}
rather than
if (a) b;
This makes it easier to put breakpoints on the then clause rather
than only on the entire if statement. (Robert)
