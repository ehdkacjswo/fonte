MATH-361
Added new exceptions. Replaced several instances of "IllegalArgumentException"
with a more specific exception.
For not yet released code, removed the checked "DimensionMismatchException"
from the method signature and replaced its instances with the new (unchecked)
version of the exception.
Corrected typos in Javadoc comments.
