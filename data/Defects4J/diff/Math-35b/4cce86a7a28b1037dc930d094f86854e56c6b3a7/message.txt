prepared interface for general eigendecomposition
we currently support only symmetric matrices and real eigenvalues
Jira issue MATH-235 asks for asymmetric matrices support, which needs
an API adaptation.
Preparing the interface yet avoids introducing incompatibility later.
The current status is explained in javadoc and matrix symmetry is checked
at runtime with an InvalidMatrixException triggered if asymmetry is detected.
