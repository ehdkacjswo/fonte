Fixed a bad interaction between step handlers and event handlers in ODE
integrators.

The problem was due to an internal array from the step interpolator that
was changed by the step handlers. These array was expected to contain
the state at event time, but was overridden later on. the solution is
simply to clone the array. Note that the fact the array is reused *is*
documented in the javadoc and is a feature of the interpolators ...
