clarified the ODE package by breaking in into several sub-packages and renaming
classes. This also prepares future work for non-stiff solvers.

SwitchingFunctions is now known as EventHandler
SwitchingFunctionsHandler is now known as CombinedEventsManager

The user manual as also been slightly improved, both to reflect these changes
and to make it easier to grasp the underlying principles in our implementation
of ODE solving
