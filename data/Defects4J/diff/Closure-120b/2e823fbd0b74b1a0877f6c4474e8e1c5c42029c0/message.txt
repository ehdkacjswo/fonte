Fixes issue 370
http://code.google.com/p/closure-compiler/issues/detail?id=370
Warn when comparing the result of a TYPEOF to a string that does not correspond to a type name.
Note that the TYPEOF can be arbitrarily far from the mistyped string, and in this case we won't emit a warning, eg,
var s = typeof 123;
if (s == 'numbr') ...

The earliest this error can be detected is in caseTypeof in SemanticReverseAbstractInterpreter.java. However, all warnings are emitted during the type-checking phase, so I perform the test there in order to have access to the validator.
