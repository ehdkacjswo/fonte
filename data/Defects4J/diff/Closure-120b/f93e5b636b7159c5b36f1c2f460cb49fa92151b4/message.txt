Fixes two issues with goog.inherits:
- Makes goog.inherits gracefully accept templated subtypes.
- Prevents goog.inherits from extending the subtype's TemplateTypeMap (this was causing the extension to happen twice). TemplateTypeMaps will now only be carried through to subtypes via @extends declarations.
