Retool error reporting for the DisambiguateProperties pass. Instead of having a global on/off we now report invalidation errors only certain specified properties. This helps the case where dead code removal can strip 10k of "toObject" methods as long as that property is valid, but we have tens of thousands of other errors we don't care about.

Also removes error reporting check in TypeValidator.java since it's redundant now.
