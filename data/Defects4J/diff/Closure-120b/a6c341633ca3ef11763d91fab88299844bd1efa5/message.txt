Changing the return type of the built-in eval() function from {Object} to {*} in the standard es3.js externs file.

If your build is broken by this change, then you probably need to typecast the result of eval() as follows:

var obj = /** @type {Object} */ (eval(myStr));

Though if myStr is known to be JSON, then you should include goog.json and use goog.json.unsafeParse (or goog.json.parse):

goog.require('goog.json');
var obj = goog.json.unsafeParse(myStr);
