Update IDBFactory#open and IDBFactory#deleteDatabase to return an
IDBOpenDBRequest instead of an IDBRequest. Update IDBOpenDBRequest's
onupgradeneeded and onblocked to return an IDBVersionChangeEvent
instead of an Event. Update IDBFactory#open to conform to the spec (and
implementation) where the second parameter is the version rather than a
description.
