Subject: [lang] text.VariableFormatter to replace Interpolation and MappedMessageFormat (WAS a [POLL])

Hello:

It's been two weeks since I posted the original message below and I've
not heard negative comments on removing Interpolation and
MappedMessageFormat from the text package in favor of VariableFormatter.
I will therefore do so real soon. 

Please raise your hand you disagree.

Thanks,
Gary
