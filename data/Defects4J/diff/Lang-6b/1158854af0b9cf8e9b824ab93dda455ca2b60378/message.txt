Corrected semantics of ExceptionWithoutCause broken in CVS rev 1.3.
The point of the ExceptionWithoutCause is to test for false-positive
nested exception method signature matches.  Documented this in the
header JavaDoc for both the ExceptionWithCause and
ExceptionWithoutCause classes, and changed the nested exception method
name of the latter from getCause() to getTargetException() to avoid
conflicts with getCause() method of JDK 1.4's Exception class (which
returns Throwable).
