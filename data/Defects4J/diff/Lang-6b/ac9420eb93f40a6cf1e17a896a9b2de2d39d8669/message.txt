Exposing the unescapeXml and escapeXml methods that take Writers - LANG-260. A recent thread did point out that there are problems with the concept of escaping Xml as a single method, and instead it needs to be an xml parser that escapes the body and the attribute content differently - however we're obviously not there yet and I don't think making the existing 80/20 good enough code more usable hurts.
