Apply fix suggested by Benedikt Ritter on the ML: "The problem is, that there is no method with name "getTimeZoneOverridesCalendar()" in DateParser, so that link can't be resolved (I think you already knew that :).
I suppose the comment is meant to refer to getTimeZone() in java.util.Calendar. If so, you can fix that by changing the link to: {@link java.util.Calendar#getTimeZone()}"
