Adding in new Interpolation class for opinions. It is, apart from cleaning up,
creation of a unit test and renaming to 'interpolate', the submission from Ken
Fitzpatrick in Bugzilla: #18962.

Lang has had a class much like this before so opinions saught (I'm in fact suffering
from some major deja vu with this, need to research how many times I've committed this
type of code to Lang :) ).
