continued refactoring of optimization framework:
 - improved general interfaces at top optimization level
 - added a simple implementation of ConvergenceChecker (ObjectiveValueChecker)
 - added a general multi-start wrapper
 - changed the direct search optimizers to the new interfaces

This work is still not complete yet. The general package classes
are very close to the former design, they have almost not been changed
structurally.
