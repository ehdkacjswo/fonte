changed SVD to compute either compact SVD (using only positive singular values)
or truncated SVD (using only singular values up to a user-specified max number)
started fix of SVD solver that did not compute a least square solution
the fix is not complete yet as it seems the solution does not really gives the
smallest possible residuals. See for example the commented out parts of
testMath320A in SingularValueSolverTest.
