* Modified multiple regression newSample methods to ensure that by default in all cases,
  regression models are estimated with intercept terms.  Prior to the fix for this issue, 
  newXSampleData(double[][]), newSampleData(double[], double[][]) and 
  newSampleData(double[], double[][], double[][]) all required columns of "1's"
  to be inserted into the x[][] arrays to create a model with an intercept term;
  while newSampleData(double[], int, int) created a model including an intercept
  term without requiring the unitary column.  All methods have  been changed to
  eliminate the need for users to add unitary columns to specify regression models.
* Improved javadoc
* Improved tests
