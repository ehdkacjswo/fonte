More Serialization changes, mostly for ode and friends.

Unfortunately, had to leave some abstract base classes as Serializable, since they had no senible default construters.  But left them with meaningless UIDs, to break anyone that doesn't override it.

Of course, if anyone has a better patch, I'm happy to implement it.  At this point, the serialization changes for [math] should be almost done.
