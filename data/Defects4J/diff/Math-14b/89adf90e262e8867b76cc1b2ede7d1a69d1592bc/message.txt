This house-cleaning improves UnivariateImpl, in a number of ways.

1.) insertValue is abolished and its contents are now in addValue

2.) UnivariateImpl now extends AbstractStoredUnivariate to deligate to
 those methods directly for calculating statistics when storage is active, all methods
 deligate to AbstractStoreUniv when the DoubleArray is no longer null. This also means
that a majority of the StoreUnivariate interface is now implemented in Univariate to provide
deligates when storage is active, and to throw runtime exceptions when its not (this at least until 
we establish rolling implementations for those methods). We should consider consolidating the 
StoreUnivariate interface into the Univariate interface

3.) Calculations in addValue have been reorganized, only calculations for
the storageless solution are now present in this class. otherwise the value is 
added/Rolling to the Double array when appropriate.

I'm satisfied that it passes all Unit tests.
