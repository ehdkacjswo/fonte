MATH-867
Previous commit was missing a crucial modification (in the "repair" method),
an inconsistency which entailed the failing of some tests.
With that modification (thanks to Nikolaus Hansen), it was established that
the "encode" and "decode" steps were indeed useless. This commit thus removes
them, and all the code that was necessary only because of those two methods.
Finite and infinite can now be freely mixed.
Unit tests that depended on those limitations were also removed (thus also
the one that was added following MATH-865).
