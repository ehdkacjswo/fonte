Differentiable function can trigger any MathIllegalArgumentException.

One very important case corresponds to an unsupported derivation order.
The order is not enforced in the API, but is specified as the properties
of the DerivativeStructure argument, as well as the number of free
parameters. Some functions have no limitation on this order (typically
functions implemented using only the DerivativeStructure API), but some
functions may limit the derivation order to 1 or 2 as they implement the
differentiation themselves or through finite differences.
