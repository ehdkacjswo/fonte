NonPositiveDefiniteMatrixException": Changed base class, and modified message so
that it is (a little) less misleading (it is closer to the actual check which can
only report that it detects non-definite-positiveness at some point of the
transformation).
Changed test in "CholeskyDecompositionImpl" to allow "O" for the threshold while
keeping the requirement that the element must be strictly positive.
