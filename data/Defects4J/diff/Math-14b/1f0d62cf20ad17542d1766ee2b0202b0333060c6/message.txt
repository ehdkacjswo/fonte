MATH-874
Reduced number of overridden public "optimize" methods (replaced by protected
"optimizeInternal"): whenever the code is ready for 4.0, only the base class's
"optimize" method should define the public API (subclass specifics are handled
in overridden "optimizeInternal" which must call the base class's version to
handle the common setup).
