Enabled reseeding of the random generators used by EmpiricalDistributionImpl
and ValueServer.  Modified ValueServer to pass its RandomData instance to
the EmpiricalDistributionImpl that it creates when used in DIGEST_MODE, so
reseeding ValueServer works as expected.  Changed EmpiricalDistributionImpl
constructor to take a RandomDataImpl instead of just RandomData (so the
instance member could be reseeded.)
