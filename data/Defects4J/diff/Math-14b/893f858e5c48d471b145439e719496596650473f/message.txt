Finalized fix for MATH-880.

This version should be much more robust on polygons computation than the
earlier ones. Note that the hyperplaneThickness parameter is a key
tuning parameter in difficult cases like the one involved in the issue.
As shown in the corresponding unit test, the value had to be raised to
1.0e-8 in order for the test to pass correctly.
