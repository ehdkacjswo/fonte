Change on 2010/04/21 by nick

        Change EventTarget to be an interface rather than a concrete
        class. Implement required methods on classes that derive from
        EventTarget. I didn't want to convert derived classes to be
        interfaces in this CL, but many of them should be changed.

        Original change by nassar

        7th times a charm!
