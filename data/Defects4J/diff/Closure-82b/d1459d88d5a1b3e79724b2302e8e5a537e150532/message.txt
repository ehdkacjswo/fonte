handle the case where an @enum is aliased.
this caused a compiler crash because CollapseProperties happens
in two steps:
1) Collapse all references
2) Collapse all declarations
Sometimes, during step (2), we need to create aliases to object
literal keys. Introducing these new aliases changes whether
or not a property should be collapsed. So we need to modify
the predicate for deciding whether a property should be collapsed
so that it is consistent over the life of the pass.
