RFC: An AST builder helper class.  This class has two goals:
1) have a simpler method of building the AST for those new to the
compiler.
2) create a more readable AST construction. Rather than something like:
Node fn = new Node(Token.FUNCTION, Node.newString(Token.NAME, "fn"),
new Node(Token.PARAM_LIST, new Node(Token.NAME, "a"), new
Node(Token.NAME, "b")),new Node(Token.BLOCK));
you would have:
Node fn = function(name("fn"), paramList(name("a"),name("b")),
block());

The intent is that the the referencing class will have a "import static
Ast.*".
