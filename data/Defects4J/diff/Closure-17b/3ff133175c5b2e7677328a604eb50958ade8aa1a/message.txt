Almost at all instances GearsHttpRequest and XMLHttpRequest are used
synonymously. However, method 'open' has different signature for both the
object and results in WARNING during compilation:
---
javascript/closure/net/xhrio.js:481: WARNING - Function this.xhr_.open:
called with 3 argument(s). Function requires at least 2 argument(s) and no
more than 2 argument(s).
this.xhr_.open(method, url, true);  // Always async!
---
Some team has started defining their own externs that fixes this warning for
them.
This changelist adds an optional parameter, which should be taken care this
difference.
