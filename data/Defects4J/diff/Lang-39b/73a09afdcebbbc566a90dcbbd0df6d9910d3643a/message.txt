Making the EntityArrays class public by cloning the arrays when they are accessed. API might need a sanity check as this is the old Entities stuff. Also changing the arrays to be private and the rest of the code to use the cloning methods. This does add performance overhead, but I think it'll be negligible and better to practice safe coding. Part of LANG-505
