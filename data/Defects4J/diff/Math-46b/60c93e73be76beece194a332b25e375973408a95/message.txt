Replaced Raw types by Parameterized types where appropriate.
The various ArrayList, HashSet and HashMap used in math have
be restricted to the content they are intended for.
This removes lots of warnings that have appeared after the
switch to Java 5, and improves safety (for example the categories
used by OneWayAnova are guaranteed to be double arrays at compile
time).
Two difficult cases where not handled here: the Frequency class
and the Fitness interface. The first one mixes types and needs to
be studied before any change is attempted. The second one generates
some side effects on the overall package which is still under development.
