Added the getThrowableCount(Throwable), getThrowables(Throwable),
indexOfThrowable(Throwable, Class), and indexOfThrowable(Throwable,
Class, int) methods factored out of NestableDelegate, as suggested by
Stephen Colebourne <scolebourne@btopenworld.com>.  Added a TODO for
the remaining methods he suggested moving.
