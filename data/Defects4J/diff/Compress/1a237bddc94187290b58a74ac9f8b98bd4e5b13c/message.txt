COMPRESS-227 ensure ZipFile#getEntry only returns entries that will
return non-null InputStreams in getInputStream.

nameMap isn't used before all local file headers are parsed so it is
easier to only populate it then.  This not only ensure it only
contains ZipArchiveEntries that are known to the entries map, it also
simplifies the case where an entry's name changes due to extra fields.
