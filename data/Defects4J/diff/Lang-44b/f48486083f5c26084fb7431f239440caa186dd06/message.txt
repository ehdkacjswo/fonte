CAUSE_METHOD_NAMES: Repurposed CAUSE_METHOD_NAME to be a list of
method names which may yield a wrapped exception.

getCause(Throwable): Now just wraps getCause(Throwable, String[]),
passing in CAUSE_METHOD_NAMES as its list of method names.

getCause(Throwable, String[]): Refactored code extracted from
getCause(Throwable) which looks at a list of method names, plus a
"detail" field.

getCauseUsingMethodName(): Swapped parameter order for consistency.

getCauseUsingFieldName(): New method which introspects fields instead
of methods.
