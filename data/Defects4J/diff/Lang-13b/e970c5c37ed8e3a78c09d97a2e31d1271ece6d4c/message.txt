Refactor code in ToStringBuilder.reflectionToString(...) into a new subclass called ReflectionToStringBuilder.
All of the ToStringBuilder.reflectionToString(...) forward their calls to equivalent methods in ReflectionToStringBuilde.
ReflectionToStringBuilder can  be subclassed to provide Field or value filtering.
Since the unit tests exercis ToStringBuilder.reflectionToString(...) which then forwards those calls to ReflectionToStringBuilder, and ReflectionToStringBuilder does not provide new features (yet), there are no new unit test cases (yet).
