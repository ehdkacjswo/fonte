Moving availableLocaleSet and availableLocaleList to both lazily initialize in a separate synchronized method. This brings the two pieces of code into line with each other, allows availableLocaleSet() to be unsynchronized as desired in LANG-488 and removes the static initialization of availableLocaleList() as requested in LANG-511
