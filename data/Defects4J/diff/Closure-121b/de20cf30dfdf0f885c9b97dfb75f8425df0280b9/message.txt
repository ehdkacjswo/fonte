Add an inliner option to inline function without considering whether "capture" of variables. Traditionally, we have avoiding inlining function with closure into scope (because they might capture unintended values) or inline functions that require temporaries into scopes that contain closures (because the temps might leak into the closure scopes).
This CL does not include a means of enabling the option.
