Rhino supports 2 error reporter apis: the old one (which uses line/column),
and an IdeErrorReporter (which uses source offset).

The IdeErrorReporter exposes more accurate information about the error
(mostly because the people building IDEs care more about this), so
let's use that one when it's available.
