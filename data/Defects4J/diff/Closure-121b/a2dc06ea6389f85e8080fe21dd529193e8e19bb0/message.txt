"Stable naming" for ReplaceIdGenerators.

* Update the report created by the pass to actually contain enough
information to enable stable renaming:
"consistent" id generators no record the original name
"unique" id generators now also record the complete source
location of the string being replaced.
* Add a compiler option to provide the previous recorded mappings
* Enable using the previous mappings as a hint for current namings.
