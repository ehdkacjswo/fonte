Deprecated DifferentiableUnivariateFunction.

The interface and its implementations should be removed for 4.0. The
remaining uses in the library are only there for compatibility.
Everything else now use the new UnivariateDifferentiableFunction
interface and DerivativeStructure, which allow both arbitrary
differentiation order and arbitrary number of free parameters.

The next step for 3.1 is to replace the multidimensional functions (i.e.
multivariate functions, vector valued functions and matrix valued
functions).
