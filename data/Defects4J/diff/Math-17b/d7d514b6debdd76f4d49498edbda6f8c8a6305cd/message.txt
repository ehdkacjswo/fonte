MATH-425
Removed usage of exceptions defined in the package "linear". Added
replacements in package "exception". Modified tests to catch the
new exception type. Deleted the deprecated package "estimation" (test
failed because of the changes).
Deprecated "MaxIterationsExceededException".
Changes in package "optimization.general" were necessary to comply with
the new exceptions and to be consistent in reporting the actual cause
of failure.
