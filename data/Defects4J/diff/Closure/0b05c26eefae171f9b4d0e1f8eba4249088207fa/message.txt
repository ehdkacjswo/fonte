Tweaks to function inlining:
- an unnamed function expression containing a inner unnamed function
expression should not be disallow because the names are the same.
- a caller that only contains the function definition to be inlined should
not consider the candidate to be a capturing function.
- allow inlining a function containing an inner function that
references arguments.
- disallow inlining a function into a function containing eval.
- when inlining a function containing a function declaration, rewrite
it a var declarations and function expressions to avoid introducing
function declaraions into contexts disallowed by ES5 strict.
