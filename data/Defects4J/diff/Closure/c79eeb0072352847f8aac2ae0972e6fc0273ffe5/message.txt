Bringing the WebGL externs file up to date with the modern WebGL spec. This
removes types and constants that are no longer defined (and not defined in any
shipping browser), cleans up the names for functions and parameters such that they match the spec IDL, and adds missing methods and types. Some minor reordering was done to match the order of the IDL to make it easier to update in the future.
