I've heard people argue that it's best practice to specify
the 'this' type even if you don't use it. I kind of agree.
Once we have template types rolled out, then it might make sense
to turn this warning on. But while they're not rolled out, we can't
really expect people to do what this warning asks, and
it's making the rollout a lot harder.
