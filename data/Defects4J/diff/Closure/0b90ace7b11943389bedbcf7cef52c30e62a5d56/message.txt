Update for recent changes to WebAudio API

https://dvcs.w3.org/hg/audio/raw-file/tip/webaudio/specification.htm

AudioContext.createGainNode() has been changed to createGain()
AudioContext.createDelayNode() has been changed to createDelay()
AudioContext.createJavaScriptNode() has been changed to createScriptProcessor()

class AudioGainNode renamed to GainNode
class JavaScriptNode renamed to ScriptProcessorNode (and constructor arguments changed.)

I didn't add @deprecated tags because the old APIs are still shipping in some browsers.
