Added a way to compute both the final state in an Initial Value Problem (IVP)
for Ordinary Differential Equations (ODE) and its derivatives with respect to
initial state and with respect to some problem parameters. This allows wrapping
ODE solvers into optimization or root finding algorithms, which in turn can be
used to solve Boundary Value Problems (BVP). There are no implementations (yet)
of BVP solvers in the library.
