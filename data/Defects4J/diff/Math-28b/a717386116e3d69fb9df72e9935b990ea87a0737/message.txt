All step interpolators for ODE integrators now provide interpolation for
both the state and its time derivatives. The interpolated derivatives are
the exact derivatives of the interpolated state, thus preserving consistency.
The general step handlers hence do not need to call the derivation function
anymore. The fixed step handlers also get the time derivative of the state
as an additional argument along with the state when they are called.
