Changed the default max growth factor for multistep methods using Nordsieck representation.
The previous value (10.0) was far too big and lead to numerical instability at high orders
because the last component of the Nordsieck vector, which has a low accuracy, could be
multiplied by 10^k which was ... huge.

These integrators are at least usable now!
