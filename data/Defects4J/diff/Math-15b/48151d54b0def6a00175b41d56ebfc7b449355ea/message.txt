MATH-698
Made "CMAESOptimizer" a subclass of "BaseAbstractMultivariateSimpleBoundsOptimizer".
The original code does not support mixing finite and infinite bounds (no constraints)
on the variables; a check for this incompatibility is thus performed, throwing a
"MathUnsuppportedException" if failing.
