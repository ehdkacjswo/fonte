The following changes were made to the Univariate implementation.  The public
interface of Univariate was extracted in an interface of the same name.
Univariate, an interface, is now implemented by UnivariateImpl which contains
all code originally present in the original Univariate implementation.

* StoredUnivariate is an interface which extends Univariate and adds
measures not available in the superinterface such as mode, kurtosis, and skew

* StoredUnivariateImpl provides an implementation which uses the
ExpandableDoubleArray for internal storage.  Calculations are performed
on demand *each* time a particular measure is required no state is
maintained by this implementation.

* Univariate provided methods addValue(int), addValue(float), addValue(long).
There functions were removed as no cast is required - all of these
assignments are widening conversions - no cast required

* Removed the name property from Univariate - property not relevant to
univariate statistics
