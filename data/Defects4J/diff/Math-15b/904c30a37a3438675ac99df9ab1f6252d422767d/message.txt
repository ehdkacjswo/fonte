Added a way to create DerivativeStructure from all derivatives.

In some cases, users may already have all the derivatives available at
once. It was impossible to use this knowledge and create the object, so
users had to user dirty tricks like adding together variables holding
value and zero derivative with variables holding derivatives and zero
value.
