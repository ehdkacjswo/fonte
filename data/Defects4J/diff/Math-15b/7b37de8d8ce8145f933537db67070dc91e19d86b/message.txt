Improved linear RealMatrixImpl and BigMatrixImpl performances.
The main changes are the following ones:
 - use directly the storage array when possible for
   diadic operations (add, subtract, multiply), as
   suggested by Phil, this avoids the cost of the
   generic getEntry method
 - replaced custom indices checks by simple use of
   the JVM checks and ArrayIndexOutOfBoundException
 - put row arrays reference in local variables to
   avoid multiple checks in double loops
 - use final variables where possible
 - removed unneeded array copying
 - added a constructor to build a matrix from an
   array without copying it where it makes sense

The speed gain is about 3X for multiplication. Performances
for this operation are now on par with Jama.
