Addition of a BeanListUnivariateImpl which can gather univariate statistics on a
List of JavaBeans.  This implementation extends the ListUnivariateImpl, and uses the
PropertyUtils classes from commons-beanutils.  With this implementation, the following
is possible:

List persons = new ArrayList();
// populate array with 100 persons
Univariate ageU = new BeanListUnivariateImpl( persons, "age" );
Univariate incomeU = new BeanListUnivariateImpl( persons, "jobInfo.income" );
System.out.println( "Mean age is: " + ageU.getMean() );
System.out.println( "Mean income is: " + incomeU.getMean() );

Better error handling is needed near our use of PropertyUtils.

This patch introduces a dependency on commons-beanutils, which in turn depends
on commons-collections and commons-logging.
