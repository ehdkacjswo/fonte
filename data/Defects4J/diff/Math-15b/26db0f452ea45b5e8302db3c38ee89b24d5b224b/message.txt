Project dependencies for commons-collctions and commons-lang were pointing to the SNAPSHOT of both.  When this was iriginally done, it was agreed that pointing to a SNAPSHOT was not an option for a release.  Now that compatible version of these to component have been released, the versions have been updated.  Commons Math now depends on collections 2.1 and lang 2.0.
