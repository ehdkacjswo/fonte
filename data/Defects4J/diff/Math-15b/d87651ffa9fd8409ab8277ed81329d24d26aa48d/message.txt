Modifications to the ConjugateGradient class and unit tests
  - altered the way iterations are counted: Incrementor is incremented prior to any modification to the current state, so that the solver is in a consistent state (accessible residual corresponds to the last estimate of the solution), even in case of MaxCountExceededException occuring.
  - modified some tests which were not testing anything.
