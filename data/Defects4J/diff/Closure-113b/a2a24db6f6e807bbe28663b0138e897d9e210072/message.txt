Automated g4 rollback.

*** Reason for rollback ***

.get and .invoke return {*}, the "ALL" type. Unfortunately, the ALL type is still type checked, and apparently doesn't include functions.

I believe changing it to {?} will remove all type checking from returned values unless the returned value is explicitly "cast" to something specific.

*** Original change description ***

Update angular.js externs to show angular.bootstrap returns an angular.$injector.
