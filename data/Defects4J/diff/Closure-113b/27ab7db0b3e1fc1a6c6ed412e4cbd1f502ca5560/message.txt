Automated g4 rollback.

*** Reason for rollback ***

broke a couple of tests

some people are being crazy and are actually using iframes.js as a
source file.

*** Original change description ***

Define a type for the Iframes API so you can do things like:

/**
* @type {!iframes.Iframes}
*/
this.iframes_ = window.parent.iframes;
