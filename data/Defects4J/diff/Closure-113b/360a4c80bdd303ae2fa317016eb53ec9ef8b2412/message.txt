Change a number of indexedDB functions to take primitive and array types instead of !Object type for keys and * for values, in accordance with the documentation at https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/IndexedDB and http://www.w3.org/TR/IndexedDB/#key-construct)

This includes the final changes to the Index and Cursor classes, and corresponding extern changes

This has the potential to introduce compiler type-check errors
