Support removing properties defined using "this" as part of
RemoveUnusedPrototypeProperties. This requires handling properties
assigned expressions containing side-effects properly which was not
the case prior to this change.  I expect we got away with it because
prototype properties are generally assigned literals or simple variable
references.

As part of this change I also change the rules, so that any property
write (=, +=, ++) on a prototype or this property is removalable, and
other writes to the property don't prevent removal of the candidates.
Object property definitions are simply one more write now so don't
automatically rescue other definitions unless used in a known method
(JSCompiler_renameProperty, goog.reflect.object).

This effective replaces RemoveUnusedClassProperties
