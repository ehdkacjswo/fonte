From Phil Steitz patch submission for Issue #20175

The attached patch includes the following improvements to Univariate and
UnivariateImpl:

* Improved efficiency of min, max and product maintenance when windowSize is
  limited by incorporating suggestion posted to commons-dev by Brend Worden
  (added author credit).  Thanks, Brent!

* Added javadoc specifying NaN contracts for all statistics, definitions for
  geometric and arithmetic means.

* Made some slight modifications to UnivariateImpl to make it consistent with
  NaN contracts

* All interface documentation moved to Univariate. The interface specification
  includes the NaN semantics and a first attempt at clealy defining exactly
  what "rolling" means and how this effects what statistics are defined when.

* Added test cases to verify that min, max, product are correctly maintained
  when "rolling" and to verify that NaN contracts are satisfied.
