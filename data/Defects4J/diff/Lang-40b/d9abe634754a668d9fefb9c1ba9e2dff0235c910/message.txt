Replace the Javadoc pattern "A Matcher which matches the XXX character." with "Matches the XXX character.". (A matcher matches of course ;-) Use the active voice or “third-person verb form”, I only know it is called the “third-person verb form” because I read it in the most excellent tiny little book “The Elements of Java Style”.)
