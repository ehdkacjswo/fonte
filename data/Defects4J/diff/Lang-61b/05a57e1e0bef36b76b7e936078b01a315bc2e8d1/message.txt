Tenfold improvement in performance for leftPad, rightPad and repeat when repeat is over a String of length 1, by implementation of a padding method. The padding method is kept private for the moment.

Also a modification of containsOnly so it has a partner method indexOfAnyBut. Unit Test added for indexOfAnyBut.
