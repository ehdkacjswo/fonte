Adds a method to export module dependencies as JSON.

Enables output of individual module compilation units for modules
derived from CommonJS based input files if the flag --module=auto
is given to the binary.

Introduces a virtual root-module for all common JS derived modules
which every module depends on, to make the module graph happy.
Fixes issue 764
