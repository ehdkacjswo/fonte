Some small things I noticed in TypeCheck.java while working on issue 370.

param_list in visit:
A param_list is always under a function, otherwise we'd have a parsing error.

new:
typeable is set to true at the beginning of visit, and visitNew can't mutate it.

visitReturn:
Misplaced returns can't happen, they'd have been caught during parsing.
