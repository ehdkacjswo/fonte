Automated g4 rollback.

*** Reason for rollback ***

Smart name removal is too aggressive with code inlined into global scope.

*** Original change description ***

-Run SmartNameRemoval a second time, after the optimization loop.
-This causes goog.events to be compiled down to nothing when compiled on its own.
-Caused a .1% decrease for superpudu and an 4 byte increase for mobile docs
-Feel free to try compiling //experimental/users/agrieve/jstweaks:bin2 with
and without this change to see it in action.
