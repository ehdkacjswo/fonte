Automated g4 rollback.

*** Reason for rollback ***

This doesn't work for Rhino classes where toString returns {java.lang.String|null}

Seems like we should make this change more conservatively, by doing
this only in cases where the "toString" is called to append to a
string literal or similiar.

*** Original change description ***

Transform toString() calls to string literal concatonation. (Helps
string simplification in some cases)
