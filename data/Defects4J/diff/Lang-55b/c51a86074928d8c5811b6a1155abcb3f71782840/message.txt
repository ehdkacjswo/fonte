Bugzilla Bug 30855
[lang] Additional constructor for EqualsBuilder and isEquals member access.
Addressing: "Finally, can they change the member "isEquals" from private to
protected?  At present, I cannot subclass EqualsBuilder and use this member."

I've added:

protected void setEquals(boolean isEquals)

which in conjunction with:

public boolean isEquals()

allows one to access the isEquals.
