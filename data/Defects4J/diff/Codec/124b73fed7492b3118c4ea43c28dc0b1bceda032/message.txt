Removed all checkstyle violations from Base64, and the
language encoders.  Most of the checkstyle violations fixed
were violations dealing with the placement of operators
on a newline instead of on the end of the previous line.

In addition to the checkstyle fixes, DoubleMetaphone now
handles two cases C with a Cedilla and N with a tilde (ene).
