Added the ability to customize the Provider which is used
to get an instance of MD5 and SHA.  By default, this
Utils class will search the list of available Provider objects
for implementations, but if you want to supply your own
Provider object you may do so by calling the static method
setProvider on DigestUtils. + Also, brought test coverage
of DigestUtils up to 100%
