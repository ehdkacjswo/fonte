Add tests to check for locale-independent lower-casing

When the default locale is set to Turkish, "I".toLowerCase() returns "Ä±",
the dotless I. The method toLowerCase() is used throughout the code to
normalize values. But none of these should be locale-sensitive. That's why
right now all the added tests are failing.
