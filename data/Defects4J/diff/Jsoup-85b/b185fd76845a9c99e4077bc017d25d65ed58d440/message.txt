patch about  issue #836 addChildren is quadratic
when add many children, the origin implementation will move childNodes array per loop.(method add(index, obj)),
a performance improvement was made using addAll(index, objs).there are three steps:
1. reparent all the children
2. use addAll(index, objs) to insert children
3. reset sibling index
it is very similar with method addChildren(Node... children)
