Restrict the missing requires warning so that it no longer complains when
an inner class is referenced but only an outerclass is required.

That is, this is now acceptable:

goog.require('foo.bar.Baz');
var x = new foo.bar.Baz.Bam(); // did not require Bam explicitly

This change makes the compiler support the recent style guide change
stating that all inner classes and enums of a class should be in the same
file, and that only the outermost class should be provided/required.
