	A new var-collection mechanism for RemoveUnusedVars.  In the
	new mechanism, we only traverse a subtree for references if it
	might have side-effects, or if its return value is used.  If
	its return value is stored in a variable, then we store a
	continuation, and execute the continuation iff that variable
	is referenced.

	This is a more general formulation of RemoveUnusedVars's current
	strategy ("traverse a function iff it's referenced").
