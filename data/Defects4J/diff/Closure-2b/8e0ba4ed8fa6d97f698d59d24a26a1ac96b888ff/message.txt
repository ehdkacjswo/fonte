Add Definition#isInExterns().

Changed the Definition interface to indicate whether a definition comes from the exports or not.

Changed NameReferenceGraph and SimpleDefinitionFinder to provide this information (which they are
already calculating for internal use) when creating Definitions.

PureFunctionIdentifier also creates definitions in PureFunctionIdentifier#getCallableDefinitions(). I had
to change this from a static method to an instance method to be able to access the instance variable
map that stores whether a function was defined in externs or not. Nothing seems to rely on that
method being static, but it probably needs some scrutiny.
