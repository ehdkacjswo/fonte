Added a way to trigger only increasing or decreasing events in ODE.

The method used is completely different from what was suggested in the
request report. It is fully compatible with previous versions and most
importantly has no side effects on users that do not need this feature,
as it is based on an upstream filtering of the event definition
function. The events detection logic is not modified and it fact it does
not even know events are filtered before they are detected.
