Adds the HTMLImageElement 'crossOrigin' property to the externs.
This is a new tag being added to the spec to help tighten security regarding
handling of cross-domain resources.  More information here:

http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/embedded-content-1.html#attr-img-crossorigin

Specifically, recent updates to Chrome and WebGL have made it so that an image
fetched without the crossOrigin property cannot be uploaded to a texture for
display via WebGL.  This plugs the cross-domain image stealing vulnerability
