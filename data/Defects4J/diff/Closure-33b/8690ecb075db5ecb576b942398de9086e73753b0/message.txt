Fixed the type definition for:
Array.prototype.reduce
Array.prototype.reduceRight

The existing definition requires initialValue, if provided,
to be of type Object, but it really can be any type.

Or more exactly, it should be the same type as the first arg to
the callback and as the return type of reduce itself, but I don't know how
to do type variables in JsCompiler.
