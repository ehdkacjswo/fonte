Automated g4 rollback.

*** Reason for rollback ***

The previous change made the renaming map created by
ProcessClosurePrimitives strict, so that it returned null if
the item was not in the map. I should have noticed this.
This map needs to be loose, so it doesn't rename anything if
it's not in the map.
