Refactored forwardTo() api into a regular answer at the AdditionalAnswers. Brice - stay happy - I decided to change forwardTo into delegatesTo() because we've already talked in the javadocs about 'delegating' in few places. So I wanted to use a consistent language. We haven't yet released so you can still convince me why should we stop talking about 'delegate' in favor of 'forward'. Tweaked some javadocs.
