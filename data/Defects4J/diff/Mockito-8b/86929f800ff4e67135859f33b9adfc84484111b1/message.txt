Fixed issue 122
In order to allow user to use single any() matcher for varargs I introduce anyVararg() matcher
Unfortunately, it is not possible to use (Object[]) anyObject() to match any vararg due to the fact that verification picks up extra redundant invocations. Also it would have broken the backwards compatibility.
