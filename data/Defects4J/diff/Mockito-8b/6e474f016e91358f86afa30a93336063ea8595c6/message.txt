In order to keep the jars tidy and not include test-only jars (new powermock reflect utils) in output distribution I refactored the locations of jar and made changes to the build script as well.
In the process I updated sources jars for hamcrest & objenesis(downloaded them straight from springsource) and renamed them according to our naming convention for consistency.
