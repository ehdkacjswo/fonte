- in order to start seperating serializable funtionality (sorry 5 hg versions again)
-- created a MockitoMethod Interface
-- changed MockitoMethod to SerializableMockitoMethod which implements MockitoMethod
-- return MockitoMethod everywhere we were calling the getMethod before
-- added methods to MockitoMethod that match the methods we were using from a normal Method

- in order to begin separation of serializable from non-serializable mocks
-- renamed MockitoMethodProxy to SerializableMockitoMethodProxy
-- created MockitMethodProxy interface
-- return MockitoMehtodProxy in all classes that were using a MethodProxy. (CGLIBHacker, FilteredCGLIBProxyRealMethod, HasCGLIBMethodProxy, MethodInterceptorFilter)

- in order to begin separation of serializable from non-serializable mocks
-- renamed MockitoMethodProxy to SerializableMockitoMethodProxy
-- created MockitMethodProxy interface
-- return MockitoMehtodProxy in all classes that were using a MethodProxy. (CGLIBHacker, FilteredCGLIBProxyRealMethod, HasCGLIBMethodProxy, MethodInterceptorFilter)

- in order to begin separation of serializable from non-serializable mocks
-- add serializable MockSetting
-- when creating MockitoMockProxy look at the isSerializable setting and create SerializableMockitoMockProxy or DelegatingMockitoMockProxy
-- not sure about the createMockitoMethodProxy in IMockHandler

- in order to begin separation of serializable from non-serializable mocks
-- added createMockitoMethod to IMockHandler and MockHandler (still need to ask szczepan about this??? but is only place that has settings)
--- createMockitoMethod determines which MockitoMethod to create based on MockSettings.isSerializable.
-- changed Invocation to take MockitoMethod instead of Method
