Refactored MockingDetails.

Although the factory method looked sweet I'd prefer to have MockingDetails interface. It made sense to include the mockingDetails() method in the core api (Mockito class).

rename : test/org/mockito/MockingDetailsTest.java => test/org/mockitousage/basicapi/MockingDetailsTest.java
