avoid releasing new version if binaries the same

Fixes #105 (more info on this ticket).

- exposed an existing method on the RelelaseNotesBuilder
- added new task that checks equality of the binaries
- hooked up the task so that the release is not triggered if binaries the same
- some tidy-up is still needed
