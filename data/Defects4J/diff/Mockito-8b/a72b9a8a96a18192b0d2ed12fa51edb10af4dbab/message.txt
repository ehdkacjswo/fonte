Fixed issue 142
In order to provide best feedback when dev misuses jUnit I forward initializer jUnit exceptions (for example: @BeforeClass must be static). This way exceptions from jUnit are correctly handled by IDE (previously, confusing Mockito exception was thrown).
Some tiny refactorings according to IDEA warnings.
