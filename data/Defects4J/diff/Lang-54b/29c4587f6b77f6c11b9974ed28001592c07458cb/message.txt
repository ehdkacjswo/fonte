I've finally worked out the oddball build and class loading issue that only seems to happen on Windows XP (SP2) since Simon reports that the ant build works fine for him on Linux. 

I can report success with "ant clean dist-build-2.1 test" on Sun Java versions:

1.5.0_03
1.5.0_02
1.4.2_08
1.3.1_14

In order achieve this; the new build.xml depends on Ant 1.6.

Version 1.2.2_017 hangs miserably for me though, as it did before.
