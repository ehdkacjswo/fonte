removed the weak assumptions for number of millis in a month/year from DateUtils. Implemented a second format method that relies on a start and an end in DurationFormatUtils, though I found that TimeZone was very important in the overloaded millis version. The two methods hand off to each other depending on whether the time is > or < than 28 days
