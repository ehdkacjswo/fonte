Group Variable Declarations in Scope. Merges all variable declarations in a scope into the first var statement in that scope.

When doing the merge, only merges var statements with <= 1 var initialization (any number of declarations is acceptable). The assignment is not merged. Only the declaration is merged. (Vishal)
