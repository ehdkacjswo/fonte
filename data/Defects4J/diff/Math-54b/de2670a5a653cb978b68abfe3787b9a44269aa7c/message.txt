MATH-461
"RealVectorFormat", "ComplexFormat", "Vector3DFormat" do not inherit anymore 
from the Java standard "Format". Removed methods that were mandated by this base
class (because they were not compatible with the new policy that CM should only
throw unchecked exceptions).
"CompositeFormat" now contains only static methods: Made it a utility class       
(i.e. with a "private" constructor).
