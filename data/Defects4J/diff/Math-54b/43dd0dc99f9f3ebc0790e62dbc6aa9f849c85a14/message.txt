Implemented a retry policy for tests that may randomly fail.

Tests classes that may fail should be annotated with @RunWith(RetryRunner.class). This custom test runner attempts to re-run tests that fail, up to a maximum number of attempts defined as a constant in the test runner (currently set to 3 attempts max).
