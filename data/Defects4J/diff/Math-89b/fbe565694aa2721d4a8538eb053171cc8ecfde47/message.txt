started refactoring of optimization framework:
 - created subpackages optimization.direct, optimization.general,
   optimization.linear (currently empty) and optimization.univariate
 - removed packages analysis.minimization and estimation
 - renamed all Cost-related interfaces/classes into Objective
   (this allows both minimization and maximization)
 - added a few new general interfaces

This work is not complete yet. The direct and general packages classes
are very close to the former design, they have almost not been changed
structurally.
