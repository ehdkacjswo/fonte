* Changed testNextHex, textNextSecureHex to use ChiSquareTest via TestUtils method
(These tests were written before either of these existed.)
* Dropped @Retry from testNextHex (no longer needed because randomData is now
initialized with a fixed seed).
* Dropped extraneous checks (must have been cut-paste error).
