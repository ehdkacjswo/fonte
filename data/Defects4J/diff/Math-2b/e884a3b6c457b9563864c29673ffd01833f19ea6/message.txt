Added a FiniteDifferencesDifferentiator class.

This class implements both UnivariateFunctionDifferentiator,
UnivariateVectorFunctionDifferentiator and
UnivariateMatrixFunctionDifferentiator. It is not limited in the
derivation order, but checks the order is consistent with the number of
points. Typically, attempting to extract 5th derivative from a 3 points
scheme will not work (a NumberIsTooLargeException will be thrown,
referencing the derivation order).
