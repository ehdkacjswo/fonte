Added a new package dealing with differentials.

The package is intended to deals with one or more free parameters and
derivation order 1 or higher.

The core elements are based on Dan Kalman paper "Recursive Multivariate
Automatic Differentiation", Mathematics Magazine, vol. 75, no. 3, June
2002. For efficiency, the recursive structure is compiled as simple
loops once for each pair (number of free parameters, derivation order).

This is work in progress, there are still some features missing even in
the most basic blocks (typically the asin, acos, atan, atant2 and taylor
methods in DSCompiler). There are also still no high level
differentiator implementation.
