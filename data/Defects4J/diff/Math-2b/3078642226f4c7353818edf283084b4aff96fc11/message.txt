Added exclude filters for RAT.

Many Apache license headers have been added in previous commits
(r1454703, r1454718, r1454719, r1454721, r1454722, r1454723). However
some test data files cannot be changed (empty file, files published by
by NIST), and in fact the content of this files is public, so they
cannot be subject to Apache license, so they are excluded from the RAT
report.
