Made EmpiricalDistribution smoothing kernel pluggable.
To enable subclasses to provide the enclosing distribution's underlying RandomGenerator
to distribution constructors, two more changes were required:
* In EmpiricalDistribution, the RandomDataGenerator field (randomData) was changed
  from private to protected.
* The private getRan() method in RandomDataGenerator returning the underlying
  RandomGenerator was renamed getRandomGenerator and made public.
