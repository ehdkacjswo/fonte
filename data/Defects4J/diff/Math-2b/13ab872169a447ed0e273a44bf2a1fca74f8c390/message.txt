In o.a.c.m3.SymmLQ.State
  - the current solution is now refined at each iteration, as the overhead is negligible
  - SymmLQ.State.xL is no longer a reference to the parameter x passed to its constructor. This way, all transparent updates of the vector x are removed.
  - SymmLQ.State.moveToCG(RealVector) is renamed SymmLQ.State.refineSolution(RealVector).
In o.a.c.m3.SymmLQ.solveInPlace()
  - SymmLQ.State.init() is now called explicitly
  - a new DefaultIterativeLinearSolverEvent is created each time it is needed (no "clever" object reuse)
  - SymmLQ.State.refineSolution(RealVector) is called explicitly
