Changed from nThreads to receiving an ExecutorService

There are a lot of different models/versions of executorservices, also
varying according to client JDK level. Give client full control of how the
executor service is created and also possibly how to schedule tasks through
a slightly lower-level cerateCallable/submit api.

Termination of ExecutorService is still controlled by ParallelScatterZipCreator,
as must be.
