Automated g4 rollback.

*** Reason for rollback ***

I was wrong about the bundles using exec-paths; they indeed use root-relative ones. Sorry for the original confusion, my bad.
I edited comments and indentation, but not the code.

*** Original change description ***

Using exec paths, instead of root relative paths, in the JSCompile bundle files.
