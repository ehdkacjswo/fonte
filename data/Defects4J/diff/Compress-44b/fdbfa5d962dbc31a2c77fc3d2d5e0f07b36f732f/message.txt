COMPRESS-375 Allow the deferred creation of `ZipArchiveEntry` for parallel zips

In some cases when creating parallel zip archive the `ZipArchiveEntry`
to be added could not be created before the `InputStream` is read.
In those cases there is no point in passing `ZipArchiveEntry` and
`InputStreamSupplier` as you can't actually defer the creation
of the `InputStream` as it's needed for the `ZipArchiveEntry`.

Add `ZipArchiveEntryRequestSupplier` to allow the deferred
creation of both `ZipArchiveEntry` and `InputStream`.
