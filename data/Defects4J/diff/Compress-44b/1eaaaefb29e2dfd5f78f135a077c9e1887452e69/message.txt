After reading up what the InfoZIP people do I changed the data descriptor
logic.  What seems to be the correct way is:

If you use a data descriptor and don't use ZIP64:

* set "version needed to extract" < 4.5

* set CRC and sizes in LFH to 0

* don't add any ZIP64 extended information extra field

* use four byte sizes in data descriptor

If you use a data descriptor and use ZIP64:

* set "version needed to extract" >= 4.5

* set CRC in LFH 0

* set sizes in LFH to 0xFFFFFFFF

* add a ZIP64 extended information extra field with sizes set to 0

* use eight byte sizes in data descriptor
