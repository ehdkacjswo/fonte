Modified ZipOutputStream to be able to avoid seeking and rewriting headers
when operating through addRaw.

The basic idea is that an entry added through addRaw is fully known at the
time we call add, so we do not need to go back in the file to rewrite fields.

Adding this third mode increases the pain of multiple code paths, and
we should probably consider a ground-up rewrite at some point.
