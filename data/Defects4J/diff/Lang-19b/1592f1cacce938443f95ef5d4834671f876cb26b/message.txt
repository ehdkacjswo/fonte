Upgrade reporting plugin versions and fix issues upgrading maven-checkstyle-plugin from version 2.3 to 2.6

maven-checkstyle-plugin 2.4 onwards uses Checkstyle 5.0 (upgraded from Checkstyle 4.4). Checkstyle 5.0 is not 100% backwardly compatible with release 4.4 and the following changes need to be made to make it work. See the Release Notes for details of incompatible changes and fixes here:
