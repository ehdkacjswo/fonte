More tests, more bugfixes (aka rewrite of the guts). 

It's looking much better, the only edge case that throws it for a loop is if things start on the 29th of February in a year. I've hacked it in the day mode, but I'm not sure why I had to do that - however I trust the brute force test to be right in day mode. 
In month mode, it's even trickier as to what the correct answer is. How many months between 29th Feb and 28th of Feb the next year? The answer is 11, or with days included it's 11 months and 28 days. I can't see any reason to define that better, so I'm declaring that law. 

Things are weird if you start on Feb 29 :)
