Committing a rewrite of StringEscapeUtils guts - LANG-505. Entities.java can now go away. Most of the code is in the new text.translate package. More work is needed, including what to actually define as 'ESCAPE_XML' etc, but it's now easy for someone to look at the source to EscapeUtils and UnescapeUtils and put their own ESCAPE_XML variable together, and with lots of reuse value.
