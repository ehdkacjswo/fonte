Modify maven build to add two non-standard attributes to the jar's manifest file to indicate the values of "maven.compile.source" and "maven.compile.target". Also modify the build to include an "Implementation-Vendor-Id" of "org.apache" in the jar's manifest.

The two non-standard entires created in the manifest file will look something like the following:

X-Compile-Source-JDK: 1.3
X-Compile-Target-JDK: 1.3

This change serves two purposes:

  1) To provide comfort to users regarding JVM compatibility.
  2) Enable releases to be checked more easily for JVM compatibility.

The manifest specification indicates that "unknown" entries in the manifest file are ignored. These entries have been prefixed with "X-" which is a sometimes used "convention" for indicating non-standard entries.
