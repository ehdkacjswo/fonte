Refactored entity decoding.

Modified the heuristic entity decoder to be less greedy; does not
repeatedly chomp down the string until a match is found, and requires a
semicolon terminator for extended entities.

Updated Entities to use the entity decoder in Tokeniser, vs the legacy
decoder.

Fixes #224.
