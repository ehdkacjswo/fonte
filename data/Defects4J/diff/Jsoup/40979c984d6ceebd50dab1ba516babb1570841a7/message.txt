Don't register unknown tags.

Unknown tags created with Tags.valueOf(String) were being registered, so that further
.valueOf()s would return an == tag. But that's a potential memory leak, particularly with
malicious input HTML, and serves no real purpose (as .equals() still works), so that
functionality has been removed.
