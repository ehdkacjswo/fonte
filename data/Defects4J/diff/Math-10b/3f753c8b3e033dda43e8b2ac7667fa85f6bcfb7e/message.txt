Use the new differentiation framework in optimization package.

As a temporary hack for backward compatibility, some optimizers do
provide "optimize" methods which accept the new functions signatures
(i.e. MultivariateDifferentiableXxxFunction), but they do *not*
advertise it in their "implements" clause. The reason for that is that
Java forbid implementing a parameterized interface with two different
parameters. These optimizers already implement the interface with the
older functions signatures, and this cannot be removed as of 3.1.

When 4.0 will be started, the old signatures will be removed, and the
"implements" declarations will be updated.
