Another change to the stored Univariates.  The calculations are now abstracted
into an AbstractStoreUnivariate class which take responsibility for
all statistical calculations.  AbstractStoreUnivariate is implemented by
two classes:

* StoreUnivariateImpl - This class uses a ExpandableDoubleArray for
internal storage.  This class is a more efficient class in terms
of storage and cycles for users who are interested in gathering statistics
not available in the UnivariateImpl implementation.

* ListUnivariateImpl - This class is for a situation where a user might
wish to maintain a List of numeric objects outside of a StoreUnivariate
instance.  We still need to add serious error checking in the absence of
1.5's generics, but this implementation will work with any list that
contains Number objects - (BigDecimal, BigInteger, Byte, Double, Float,
Integer, Long, Short).  This implementation ultimately transforms all
numeric objects into double primitives via Number.doubleValue().

Becuase AbstractStoreUnivariate does not hold on to any state, a user
can add values through the Univariate.addValue() function OR one can
directly manipulate the contents of the List directly.
