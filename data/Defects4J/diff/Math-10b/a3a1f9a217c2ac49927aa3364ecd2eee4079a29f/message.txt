MATH-874
Refactored of the contents of package "o.a.c.m.optimization"
into the new "o.a.c.m.optim" and "o.a.c.m.fitting" packages.
* All deprecated classes/fields/methods have been removed in the
  replacement packages.
* Simplified API: a single "optimize(OptimizationData... data)"
  for all optimizer types.
* Simplified class hierarchy, merged interfaces and abstract
  classes, only base classes are generic.
* The new classes do not use the "DerivativeStructure" type.
