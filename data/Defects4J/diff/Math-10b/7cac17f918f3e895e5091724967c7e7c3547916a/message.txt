MATH-797
Initial version for Gauss-Legendre quadrature rules: the integration is
performed on the whole interval using a single rule. [Whereas the approach
used in class "analysis.integration.LegendreGaussIntegrator" is to divide
iteratively into sub-intervals (over which the integration rule is used)
until some covergence criterion is met.]
Adapted from an original code donated by Sébastien Brisard.
In the current implementation, the Gauss-Legendre rules are computed in
double precision in "LegendreRuleFactory" and high precision (using
"java.math.BigDecimal") in "LegendreHighPrecisionRuleFactory". However,
the "GaussIntegrator" class performs the integration using "double"s
whatever the precision of the rule.
The framework of "BaseRuleFactory" enables the addition of other quadrature
schemes (by overriding the "computeRule" method). [Sébastien's code already
provides Gauss-Chebyshev and Gauss-Hermite schemes (in double precision).]
